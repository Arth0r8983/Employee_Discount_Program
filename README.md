## üìù Extended Description

This project was created as a personal learning tool to practice working with Visual Basic and Windows Forms. It simulates a real-world scenario where employees receive discounts based on annual purchase history.

The program uses simple logic to:
- Accept user input for yearly spending
- Calculate a discount tier based on total purchase amount
- Display the resulting discount and savings in an easy-to-understand interface

This project helped reinforce concepts such as:
- GUI layout and form events in WinForms
- Basic object-oriented programming in Visual Basic
- Project structure and deployment using Visual Studio

Potential future improvements:
- Load employee data from a file or database
- Add authentication or multiple user support
- Export summary reports to text or CSV format
